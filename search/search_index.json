Right now, Windows 11 is the latest version of Windows, its ISO file can be downloaded from this official Microsoft server. One of the worst things you can do to your own security and privacy is downloading your OS, which is the root of all the active and passive security measures, from a 3rd party website claiming they have the official unmodified files. There are countless bad things that can happen as the result of it such as threat actors embedding malware or backdoors inside the customized OS, or pre-installing customized root CA certificates in your OS so that they can perform TLS termination and view all of your HTTPS and encrypted Internet data in plain clear text, even if you use VPN. Having a poisoned and compromised certificate store is the endgame for you, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.</p> <ul> <li>Refer to Wiki to see how to create Bootable USB flash drive with no 3rd party tools</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p> Whenever you want to install a program or app, first use the Microsoft Store or Winget, if the program or app you are looking for isn't available in there, then download it from its official website. Somebody created a nice web interface for interacting with Winget CLI here. Using Winget or Microsoft store provides many benefits:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Microsoft store UWP apps are secure in nature, digitally signed, in MSIX format. That means, installing and uninstalling them is guaranteed and there won't be any leftovers after uninstalling.</p> </li> <li> <p>Microsoft store has Win32 apps too, they are traditional <code>.exe</code> installers that we are all familiar with. The store has a library feature that makes it easy to find the apps you previously installed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Both Microsoft and Winget check the hash of the files by default, if a program or file is tampered, they will warn you and block the installation, whereas when you manually download a program from a website, you will have to manually verify the file hash with the hash shown on the website, if any.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p> Use Secure DNS; Windows 11 natively supports DNS over HTTPS and DNS over TLS.</p> <ul> <li>Use my WinSecureDNSMgr module to easily configure DNS over HTTPS in Windows</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> Only use Microsoft Edge for browser; It has the Highest-rated protection against phishing and malware, available by default on Windows OS, has tightly integrated valuable Security features such as Microsoft Defender Application Guard, Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, Hardware Enforced Stack Protection, Arbitrary Code Guard (ACG), Control Flow Guard (CFG), Tracking Prevention and Trusted built-in Secure Network feature from Cloudflare just to name a few. <p></p> <ul> <li> Always enable Two-Factor/Multi-Factor Authentication on websites, apps and services that you use. Preferably, use Microsoft Authenticator app which has backup and restore feature, so you never lose access to your TOTPs (Time-Based One-Time Passwords) even if you lose your phone. Available for Android and IOS.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> Make sure OneDrive backup for important folders (Desktop/Documents/Pictures) is enabled. It is fast, secure and works in any network condition and since it's x64 (64-bit), it can handle a Lot of small and large files simultaneously.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p> If you live in a western country, NATO country, European country or Australia, do not use VPNs. your local ISP (Internet service provider) is a lot more trustworthy than the remote VPN server's ISP. Using VPN only takes the trust from your own local ISP and puts it in the hands of the remote ISP that the VPN server uses for its Internet, Nothing else. period. Do not fall for the fake advertisements of VPN companies, you never know who is behind the VPN provider, what their political views are, their background, where their allegiance lies. The permissive civilized western world could allow a state sponsor of terrorism or some other hostile country to create a VPN company in here and gather intelligence and collect bulk data for mining, tracking etc. this has happened before and one of the most recent revelations is about a VPN provider called Betternet, based in Canada, ran by IRGC terrorists and their families abroad. Stay vigilant and smart.</p> <ul> <li>There are situations where using VPN can provide security and privacy. For example, when using a public WiFi hotspot or basically any network that you don't have control over. In such cases, use Cloudflare WARP which uses WireGuard protocol, or as mentioned, use Secure Network in Edge browser that utilizes the same secure Cloudflare network. It's free, it's from an American company that has global radar and lots of insight about countries in the world in real-time, at least 19.7% of all websites use it (2022). Safe to say it's one of the backbones of the Internet.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> Go passwordless with your Microsoft account and use Windows Hello authentication. In your Microsoft account which has Outlook service, you can create up to 10 Email aliases in addition to the 1 Email address you get when you made your Microsoft account, that means without creating a new account, you can have 11 Email addresses all of which will use the same inbox and account. You can specify which one of those Email aliases can be used to sign into your account, in the sign in preferences of your Microsoft account settings. So for example, when going passwordless, if you need you can give one of your Email aliases to others for communication or add it to a public profile of yours, then block sign in using that Email alias so nobody can send you authenticator notifications by entering that Email alias in the sign in page, and use the other 10 aliases that are private to sign into your Microsoft account with peace of mind. You can create a rule in your Outlook so that all of the Emails sent to your public Email alias will be stored in a different folder, apart from your other inbox emails. All of this can be done using free Microsoft account and Outlook webapp.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> Set a strong password for the UEFI firmware of your device so that it will ask for password before allowing any changes to be made to firmware.

In addition to all their benefits, they support <code>Mark Of The Web</code> (MOTW) or <code>zone.identifier</code>. When a file is downloaded to a device running Windows, Mark of the Web is added to the file, identifying its source as being from the internet. You can read all the information about it in here. If your USB flash drive is formatted as <code>FAT32</code>, change it to <code>NTFS</code>, because <code>FAT32</code> does not keep the <code>MOTW</code> of the files. If the file you are downloading is compressed in <code>.zip</code> format, make sure you open/extract it using Windows built-in support for <code>.zip</code> files because it keeps the MOTW of the files. If the compressed file you downloaded is in other formats such as <code>.7zip</code> or <code>.rar</code>, make sure you use an archive program that supports keeping the mark of the Web of files after extraction. One of those programs is NanaZip which is a fork of 7zip, available in Microsoft Store and GitHub, compared to 7zip, it has better and modern GUI, and the application is digitally signed. After installation, open it, navigate to <code>Tools</code> at the top then select <code>Options</code>, set <code>Propagate zone.id stream</code> to <code>Yes</code>. You can use this PowerShell command to find all the info about the Zone Identifier of the files you downloaded from the Internet.</li> </ul> <pre><code>Get-Content &lt;Path-To-File&gt; -stream zone.identifier\n</code></pre> <p></p> <ul> <li> When using Xbox, make sure you configure sign-in preference and set it to either <code>Ask for my PIN</code> or <code>Lock it down</code>. The latter is the most secure one since it will require authentication using Microsoft Authenticator app. <code>Ask for my PIN</code> is recommended for the most people because it will only require a PIN to be entered using controller.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p> A few reminders about open source programs:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Unless you are a skilled programmer who can understand and verify every line of code in the source, and spends time to personally build the software from the source, and repeats all the aforementioned tasks for each subsequent version, then seeing the source code won't have any effect on you because you aren't able to understand nor verify it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Do not assume that the entire Open Source community audits and verifies every line of code just because the source code is available, as we've seen in the XZ utility's backdoor by state sponsored actors, they can have backdoors implanted in them in broad daylight and nobody might notice it for a long time.</p> </li> <li> <p>The majority of open source programs are unsigned, meaning they don't have a digital signature, their developers haven't bought and used a code signing certificate to sign their program. Among other problems, this might pose a danger to the end-users by making it harder to create trust for those programs in security solutions such as Application Control or App Whitelisting, and makes it hard to authenticate them. Read Microsoft's Introduction to Code Signing.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> Use Microsoft account (MSA) or Microsoft Entra ID to sign into Windows. Never use local administrators. Real security is achieved when there is no local administrator and identities are managed using Entra ID. You will be able to enforce Multi-factor unlock, for example use PIN + Fingerprint or PIN + Facial recognition, to unlock your device.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> More Security Recommendations coming soon...</li> </ul> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#resources","title":"Resources","text":"<ul> <li>Microsoft.com<ul> <li>Force firmware code to be measured and attested by Secure Launch</li> </ul> </li> <li>Microsoft Learn - Technical Documentation<ul> <li>Secure Launch\u2014the Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM)</li> <li>Quick guide to Windows as a service</li> </ul> </li> <li>Germany Intelligence Agency - BND - Federal Office for Information Security<ul> <li>Analysis of Device Guard</li> <li>Device Guard Differential Analysis</li> </ul> </li> <li>Microsoft Tech Community - Official blogs and documentations</li> <li>Microsoft Security baselines - Security baselines from Microsoft</li> <li>Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) YouTube channel<ul> <li>BlueHat Seattle 2019 || Guarding Against Physical Attacks: The Xbox One Story</li> <li>Security Update Guide: The Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) investigates all reports of security vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft products and services, and provides the information here as part of the ongoing effort to help you manage security risks and help keep your systems protected.</li> <li>Microsoft Security Response Center Blog</li> </ul> </li> <li>Microsoft Security Blog</li> <li>Microsoft Podcasts</li> <li>Bug Bounty Program - With bounties worth up to <code>250,000</code>$</li> <li>Microsoft Active Protections Program</li> <li>Security Update Guide FAQs</li> <li>Microsoft On the Issues - Assessments, Investigations and Reports of APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats\u00b9) and nation-sponsored cyberattack operations globally</li> <li>A high level overview paper by Microsoft (in <code>PDF</code>), framework for cybersecurity information sharing and risk reduction.</li> <li>Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool - for software architects and developers</li> <li>Important events to monitor</li> <li>Windows Security portal</li> <li>Security auditing</li> <li>Microsoft SysInternals Sysmon for Windows Event Collection or SIEM</li> <li>Privileged Access Workstations</li> <li>Enhanced Security Administrative Environment (ESAE)</li> <li>New Zealand 2016 Demystifying the Windows Firewall \u2013 Learn how to irritate attackers without crippli</li> <li>Download Windows virtual machines ready for development</li> <li>UK National Cyber Security Centre Advice &amp; guidance</li> <li>Global threat activity</li> <li>Microsoft Zero Trust</li> <li>Understanding malware &amp; other threats, phrases</li> <li>Malware naming</li> <li>Microsoft Digital Defense Report</li> <li>Microsoft Defender for Individuals</li> <li>Submit a file for malware analysis</li> <li>Submit a driver for analysis</li> <li>Service health status</li> <li>Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence<ul> <li>Free community edition vs Premium edition comparison</li> </ul> </li> <li>Microsoft Virus Initiative</li> <li>Digital Detectives @Microsoft</li> <li>Goblin Loot - Great security related website about EDR, Cloud and Microsoft products</li> <li>Australia's Essential Eight</li> <li>NIST 800-53</li> <li>DoD's CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification)</li> <li>ISO 27001</li> <li>DoD Cyber Stigs (Security Technical Implementation Guides)</li> <li>HIPPA HITRUST</li> <li>NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2 - Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations</li> <li>Clean source principle</li> <li>Windows Message Center</li> <li>Deprecated features for Windows client</li> <li>Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architectures</li> <li>BlueHat IL 2023 - David Weston - Default Security</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#license","title":"License","text":"<p>Using MIT License.

There are at least two distinct types of Admins: Local Admin and Cloud Admin. For instance, when you are penetration testing a system that leverages enterprise cloud security solution such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), Admin access should be regarded as Cloud Admin since those devices use Microsoft Entra ID and lack Local Admin. In this situation, Cloud Admin can effortlessly disable security features as expected, rendering a pentest using Local Admin access utterly pointless.
